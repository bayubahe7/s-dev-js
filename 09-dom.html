//let learn the methods and properties we can use!
// first property to learn :
  console.log(document.title);
  // the above code access the title in javascript and log it in the console

  //if we changed title in dom it will be changed on the page 
  document.title = "New Change!";

  // next we have another property => document.body
  console.log(document.body);
  // above code show that this property is able to take the element in the body and link it to javscript code and with javscript we can change html content.
  console.log(typeof document.body);

  // above code will display that document.body is an object so it has property called innerHTML

  console.log(document.body.innerHTML);

  //the above code will take all element in the object document.body and log it into the console.

  //if we changed the content of innerHTML the will change all the content of body to new content look at the example below:
  document.body.innerHTML = "<button>bay levis!</button>"

  //another property is document.queryselector
  // it let us get any element on the page and put it inside javascript.

  console.log(document.querySelector('button'));
//EVery html element has a property .innerHTML which let us control html inside the element
  document.querySelector('button').innerHTML = "changedMan"

  //notice that if we have morethan one button on the page queryselector will only select the first one only.
  //to select all use querySelectorAll

//you se that the innerHTML PROPERTY allow us to add new html element on the web page.
*/


    /*
    document.body.innerHTML = "Levis!!!"
    // in above code document is object with properties like body and titles that we can access by dot notation!
    document.title = "Good News!"

    // the special thing about document object model is that it is linked to the web page.
    // that means if we changed certain properties in this object the web page also will change!
    //in addition to properties the dom has also methods
    //such as querysellector('.object');
